# CKS Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the Canonical Knowledge Structure (CKS) ecosystem.

The roadmap is intentionally incremental. Each release aims to preserve backward compatibility whenever possible while extending the canonical specifications and the reference implementation.

---

# Guiding Direction

The long-term objective of CKS is to provide a universal, representation-independent semantic foundation for knowledge that can be shared across:

* humans
* software systems
* databases
* programming languages
* knowledge graphs
* artificial intelligence

The reference implementation evolves together with the formal CKS specifications.

---

# Current Status (July 2026)

The project has progressed significantly beyond the original roadmap.
Key achievements since v1.3:

- v1.4–v1.6: MCP server (`cks-mcp`), event system, time-travel operations, delta version storage — **all completed**
- v1.7: Merkle-tree hashing and structural diff — **completed**
- v1.8: Three-way merge with conflict detection — **completed**

The sections below reflect the original roadmap and will be updated
in a future documentation refresh.

* Replace stderr print with structured logging in `plugin.py`.

---

# Version 1.2 — CLI Modularization ✅ (completed)

* Split `cli/__init__.py` into separate handlers (`cli/commands/`).
* Add schema validation layer for operation files.
* Improve user-facing error messages in CLI.
* Add `--strict` flag for plugin failures.

---

# Version 1.3 — Contract Strengthening (current)

* Extract `_normalize_structure()` for explicit structural comparison.
* Document the contract “specification → validator → tests → CLI → plugins”.
* Add `mypy` type-checking to CI.
* Write contract tests for the plugin system.
* Create reference plugin examples.

---

# Version 1.4 — AI/LLM Integration (MCP Server)

Planned work:

* Implement CKS MCP Server.
* Provide standard MCP tools: `construct_knowledge`, `validate_knowledge`, `query_relations`, `compare_structures`, `evolve_knowledge`.
* Publish the server as a separate package (`cks-mcp`).

---

# Version 1.5 — Semantic Tools

Planned work:

---

# Version 1.8 — Distributed Knowledge Spaces

Planned work:

* Enable linking and synchronizing multiple Knowledge Structures across different sources.

---

# Version 1.9 — Versioning and Merging

Planned work:

* Implement Git-like versioning, branching, and merging for Knowledge Structures.

---

# Version 2.0 — The Semantic Foundation

Planned goals:

* Fully distributed CKS ecosystem.
* Stable MCP and semantic tools.
* Multi-language SDKs.
* IDE support.
* Large-scale knowledge repositories.
* Integration with major AI platforms.

---

# Project Philosophy

CKS favors long-term stability over rapid feature growth.

New functionality is added only when it preserves the core principles of:

* Representation Independence
* Structural Equivalence
* Observational Purity
* Deterministic Behaviour
* Canonical Semantics

The roadmap may evolve as the specifications mature and the community grows.
