CKS Extension Constraints — Verification Records.

Status: EXTENSION, not part of the normative CKS-001..CKS-008 core
specifications. Not registered by default (see OPTIONAL_CONSTRAINTS
in `builtin.py`); callers must opt in explicitly.

Rationale
---------
CKS-001 ("Documents as Structural Projections") treats every concrete
representation of a Canonical Knowledge Structure as a projection,
never as a primary source of semantics:

    Document = Projection(CKS)

`projection.py` already extends this to vector-space representations.
This module extends it once more, in the opposite direction: instead
of projecting a Knowledge Object *outward* into a representation, a
VerificationRecord projects an *external* ground-truth check *back
into* the canonical graph:

    VerificationRecord = Projection(external check) onto a Knowledge Object

A VerificationRecord is a specialised Knowledge Object recording the
technical fact that some other canonical object (typically a
Document) was checked against an outside source of truth -- an HTTP
request, a search result, a human review -- at a specific time, with
a specific outcome. It exists to close a specific, observed failure
mode: an LLM narrating a plausible-looking verification ("HTTP 200",
a reliability score, a confidence table) without ever performing it.

What this constraint can and cannot guarantee
----------------------------------------------
This constraint enforces *shape*: required fields present and
well-typed, exactly one `verified_by` link to an existing subject,
and no qualitative judgment smuggled in alongside the technical
fact. It CANNOT verify *provenance* -- that the recorded check
actually happened. A well-formed but entirely fabricated
VerificationRecord passes this constraint exactly as cleanly as a
genuine one; static structural validation has no way to distinguish
them, and this is not a gap that can be closed inside cks-core
(CKS-001 Non-Goals: execution environments and tool ecosystems are
explicitly out of scope for the Core Specification).

Real provenance enforcement belongs one layer up: a dedicated
runtime/MCP tool should be the *sole* sanctioned constructor of
VerificationRecord objects, building them itself from the result of
an actual tool call rather than accepting caller-supplied JSON --
the same pattern already used by `validate_knowledge`, which computes
`valid` itself instead of trusting a caller-supplied boolean.

`checked_via` is deliberately a small, closed, implementation-
independent vocabulary rather than concrete tool names (e.g.
"web_fetch") -- naming a specific vendor's tool inside cks-core would
violate Representation/Implementation Independence (CKS-000,
Principle 2). A runtime adapter maps its actual tool call onto one of
these categories when constructing the record.

    """
    Every VerificationRecord object shall:

      1. have exactly one 'verified_by' relation, linking an existing
         subject object to this record;
      2. carry a well-formed 'checked_at' (ISO 8601) timestamp;
      3. carry a 'checked_via' value drawn from the closed,
         implementation-independent method vocabulary;
      4. carry a well-formed 'http_status' (100-599) when present --
         it is optional, since not every verification method
         produces one;
      5. never carry qualitative judgment fields (reliability
         scoring, confidence, recommendations) -- those are opinions
         about the subject, not facts about the check, and must not
         be presented as though they were mechanically verified.

    Deliberately NOT checked: whether 'checked_at' lies in the past.
    Comparing against wall-clock time at evaluation time would make
    Validity depend on when it is evaluated rather than exclusively
    on canonical structure, violating the Determinism principle
    (CKS-005) and Canonical Law 9 (Computability, CKS-001).

    This constraint is additive: Knowledge Structures that do not use
    the VerificationRecord type are entirely unaffected by it.
