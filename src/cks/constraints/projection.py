CKS Extension Constraints — Embedding Projections.

Status: EXTENSION, not part of the normative CKS-001..CKS-008 core
specifications. Not registered by default (see OPTIONAL_CONSTRAINTS
in `builtin.py`); callers must opt in explicitly.

Rationale
---------
CKS-001 ("Documents as Structural Projections") defines:

    Document = Projection(CKS)

i.e. any concrete representation of a Canonical Knowledge Structure
-- an article, a website, a database -- is a *projection*, never a
primary source of semantics. This module treats vector-space
representations (embeddings used for structured retrieval) as one
more instance of the same general mechanism, rather than as a
foreign concept bolted onto CKS:

    EmbeddingProjection = Projection(KnowledgeObject) into vector space

An EmbeddingProjection is a specialised Knowledge Object. Per CKS-001
("Canonical Derivations"), it records *provenance* -- which source
object it represents and by which method -- not the vector payload
itself. Storage architectures and optimization strategies are an
explicit Non-Goal of the Core Specification, so the actual vector
(and any ANN index) must live in an external store; this module only
enforces that the *reference* to that external store is present and
that the link back to a real, existing source object is intact.

This gives a concrete, mechanically checked anti-hallucination
property for retrieval: if a generation step cites an
EmbeddingProjection, NoDanglingRelationConstraint and
EmbeddingProjectionIntegrityConstraint together guarantee that
citation resolves to a real canonical object, never a fabricated one.
