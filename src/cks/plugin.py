"""
CKS Plugin — External Constraint Discovery.

This module provides a mechanism for discovering and loading canonical
validation constraints from external packages using the ``entry_points``
machinery (``importlib.metadata``).

Plugins are discovered via the ``cks.constraints`` entry-point group.
Each entry-point must reference a callable that accepts zero arguments
and returns an iterable of `Constraint` instances.

Loaded constraints are automatically registered in the canonical global
`ConstraintRegistry`.
