# Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Canonical Knowledge Structure (CKS) Python reference implementation.

The implementation follows the architecture defined by the CKS specifications while remaining completely implementation-independent.

The goal of the reference implementation is not merely to provide a working library, but to demonstrate the canonical behaviour expected from every conforming implementation.

---

# Architectural Overview

The CKS architecture is organised as a layered system.

```

Each layer has a clearly defined responsibility.

Higher layers never modify lower layers.

---

# Design Principles

The architecture follows five fundamental principles.

## Representation Independence

Knowledge is independent of its representation.

No module assumes that JSON, Python objects, or any storage backend is the primary representation.

---

## Determinism

Every public operation is deterministic.

Identical inputs always produce identical observable outputs.

---

## Observational Purity

Public operations never modify their inputs.

Every operation observes immutable knowledge structures.

---

## Layer Separation

Each module has a single responsibility.

Semantic concepts are isolated from serialization, validation, and public APIs.

---

## Implementation Independence

Every implementation is free to choose its internal algorithms provided that the observable behaviour remains identical.

---

# Core Layer

```
core.py
```

The Core layer defines the immutable semantic model.

It contains the fundamental concepts introduced in the CKS specifications:

* ObjectIdentity
* KnowledgeObject
* CanonicalRelation
* KnowledgeStructure

Every other module depends on this layer.

The Core layer has no knowledge of:

* JSON;
* validation;
* diagnostics;
* engines;
* APIs.

It only defines canonical semantic objects.

---

# Serialization Layer

```
serialization.py
```

The Serialization layer converts between canonical JSON and the semantic model.

Responsibilities include:

* parsing canonical JSON;
* serializing Knowledge Structures;
* enforcing serialization rules;
* preserving round-trip equivalence.

The serializer never performs semantic validation.

---

# Validation Layer

```
validator.py
```

The Validator implements the canonical validation pipeline.

The pipeline consists of three stages:

```text
Structural Validation
          │
          ▼
Semantic Validation
          │
          ▼
Constraint Evaluation
```

Each stage is independent.

Diagnostics produced by every stage are merged into a single ValidationResult.

---

# Constraint Registry

The validation layer includes a constraint registry.

The registry allows implementations to register additional deterministic validation constraints.

Constraints are organized into **Validation Domains** (CKS‑005):

- `structural.py` — unique identity, referential integrity.
- `semantic.py` — derivation arity, cycle detection.
- `builtin.py` — manifest that instantiates and exports all built‑in constraints.

Constraints execute after structural and semantic validation.

---

# Evolution Engine

```
evolution.py
```

The Evolution Engine implements CKS‑004 (Canonical Structure Evolution).

It provides:

- `StructuralOperator` — abstract base class for admissible transformations.
- `OperatorContract` — formal contract specifying preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.
- Genesis operators: `AddObject`, `AddRelation`.
- Decay operators: `RemoveObject`, `RemoveRelation`.
- `compose()` — apply a sequence of operators in order.

All operators are observationally pure and preserve structural invariants.

---

# Reference Engine

```
engine.py
```

The Reference Engine coordinates all canonical operations.

It provides a single implementation-independent interface for:

* construction;
* serialization;
* validation;
* comparison;
* inspection;
* extraction;
* projection;
* evolution.

The engine delegates specialised work to the appropriate modules.

It contains very little domain-specific logic itself.

---

# Public Interface

```
interface.py
```

The public interface exposes the canonical API defined by CKS-007.

Applications are expected to import functions from this module.

Typical usage:

```python
from cks import parse
from cks import validate
from cks import serialize
```

The interface hides implementation details while exposing deterministic canonical behaviour.

---

# Diagnostics

Diagnostics are represented independently of validation.

```
diagnostics.py
```

defines:

* Diagnostic
* DiagnosticSeverity
* DiagnosticCollection

Validation produces diagnostics but does not own their implementation.

This separation allows diagnostics to evolve independently.

---

# Validation Results

```
result.py
```

Validation outcomes are represented using ValidationResult.

A ValidationResult contains:

* validity;
* diagnostics;
* evaluated constraints;
* metadata.

The result object is immutable.

---

# Module Dependencies

The implementation follows a directed dependency graph.

```text
core
 │
 ├────────────┐
 ▼            ▼
serialization validator
      │        │
      └────┬───┘
           ▼
        engine
           │
           ▼
       interface
           │
           ▼
          cli
```

Evolution (`evolution.py`) depends on core and is used by engine.

Dependencies always point toward higher abstraction layers.

Circular dependencies are intentionally avoided.

---

# Typical Execution Flow

The following sequence illustrates a typical validation operation.

```text
Application
      │
      ▼
validate()
      │
      ▼
Reference Engine
      │
      ▼
Validator
      │
      ├── Structural Validation
      ├── Semantic Validation
      └── Constraint Evaluation
      │
      ▼
ValidationResult
```

Each step is deterministic and observationally pure.

---

# Extensibility

The architecture is intentionally modular.

Future versions may introduce additional components such as:

- constraint libraries;
- alternative serialization formats;
- optimisation engines;
- additional language bindings;
- CLI extensions;
- Reference Corpus (CKS‑009).

These extensions should integrate through the existing canonical interfaces without modifying the semantic model.

---

# Summary

The CKS architecture separates semantic concepts from implementation details.

Every layer has a single responsibility, and every public operation preserves the canonical guarantees defined by the CKS specifications:

* representation independence;
* determinism;
* observational purity;
* implementation independence.

The next document, **API Reference**, describes the complete public interface exposed by the Python reference implementation.
