# Changelog

All notable changes to the Canonical Knowledge Structure (CKS) project are documented in this file.

The project follows a semantic versioning strategy where practical.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- `merge()` function in the public `cks.interface` module, delegating to `KnowledgeStructure.merge()`.
- `MergeConflict` and `MergeConflictError` now exported from the top-level `cks` package.

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- `KnowledgeStructure.merge()` – three-way merge of independently evolved structures with conflict detection via object hashes, referential integrity enforcement, and structured `MergeConflictError`.
- `MergeConflict` and `MergeConflictError` types, exported from the top-level `cks` package.
- `merge()` function in `cks.interface`, wired through `ReferenceEngine`.
- `KnowledgeObject._id_hash` – cached canonical hash of `identity.id`, making `KnowledgeStructure` construction ~10× faster.
- New tests for `identity_equivalent`, `_id_hash` caching, and merge (7 new tests, total 167 passed).

### Changed
- `KnowledgeStructure.__init__` now uses each object's cached `_id_hash` instead of recomputing `_canonical_hash(id)` for every object on every construction.
- `CanonicalRelation.__init__` sets `_id_hash` explicitly, matching the cache behaviour of `KnowledgeObject.__post_init__`.

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- `KnowledgeStructure.merge()` – three-way merge of independently evolved structures with conflict detection via object hashes, referential integrity enforcement, and structured `MergeConflictError`.
- `MergeConflict` and `MergeConflictError` types.
- `KnowledgeObject._id_hash` – cached canonical hash of `identity.id`, making `KnowledgeStructure` construction (and therefore every structural edit) ~10× faster.
- New tests for `identity_equivalent`, `_id_hash` caching, and merge (7 new tests, total 167 passed).

### Changed
- `KnowledgeStructure.__init__` now uses each object's cached `_id_hash` instead of recomputing `_canonical_hash(id)` for every object on every construction.
- `CanonicalRelation.__init__` sets `_id_hash` explicitly, matching the cache behaviour of `KnowledgeObject.__post_init__`.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Merkle‑tree based canonical hashing for `KnowledgeObject` and `KnowledgeStructure`, enabling O(1) structural equivalence comparison.
- `KnowledgeStructure.diff(target)` method that computes a correct, ordered list of structural operators to evolve the structure into `target`, handling cascading relation deletions.
- `KnowledgeStructure.__hash__` is now implemented, allowing structures to be used as dictionary keys or set members.
- `KnowledgeStructure.root_hash` property for external comparison and logging.

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- `VerificationRecordIntegrityConstraint` (OPTIONAL) – validates the shape of `VerificationRecord` objects, ensuring exactly one `verified_by` relation, a well-formed `checked_at` timestamp, a valid `checked_via` method, a correct `http_status` when present, and no qualitative judgment fields.
- `OPTIONAL_CONSTRAINTS_BY_NAME` dictionary for stable name-based lookup of optional constraints (e.g., `"embedding_projection"`, `"verification_record"`).
- 12 new tests for the verification constraint (total 150 tests).

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- `extra_constraints` parameter to `validate()`, `validate_all()`, `structural_validate()`, `semantic_validate()`, `evaluate_constraints()`, `ReferenceEngine.validate()`, and `ReferenceValidator.validate()`. Allows opting in additional constraints for a single call without mutating the global registry.
- `ReferenceValidator._STAGE_ORDER` and `_scoped_registry()` to support scoped constraint execution.
- Five new tests validating scoped constraint behaviour and non-interference with the global registry (total 138 tests).

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- `EmbeddingProjectionIntegrityConstraint` — optional constraint for validating vector-space projections of Knowledge Objects (requires exactly one `represents` relation to an existing source and an external `store_ref`).
- `OPTIONAL_CONSTRAINTS` set in `builtin.py` – not auto‑registered, opt‑in per validator.
- Comprehensive tests for the new constraint (11 new tests).

### Changed
- Bumped test suite to 134 tests.

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Removed dead code in `DerivationCycleConstraint.dfs()` – an unused loop left over from the previous fix.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- **Severity comparison** now uses numeric priority instead of lexicographic string comparison, so warnings no longer incorrectly invalidate structures (bug #4).
- **DerivationCycleConstraint** no longer crashes with `KeyError` when a `derives` relation references a non-existent participant — dangling references are now safely ignored by the cycle detector (bug #3).
- **Schema CLI** (`cks schema validate`) now works after `pip install cks-core` — the canonical JSON schema is bundled as package data and loaded via `importlib.resources` (bug #5).

### Changed
- Schema file moved from `examples/json/` to `src/cks/schemas/` and declared as package data in `pyproject.toml`.

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Public function `parse_operations` in `cks.evolution` for deserializing JSON operation descriptors into `StructuralOperator` objects. Used by CLI, `cks-mcp`, and any other adapter that receives evolution requests over the wire.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Validation pipeline no longer double‑counts diagnostics. The `CONSTRAINTS` stage now evaluates only constraints tagged with that stage, instead of re‑evaluating all registered constraints.

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- `copy.deepcopy` no longer raises `TypeError` for `KnowledgeObject` and `KnowledgeStructure` (resolved `cannot pickle 'mappingproxy' object`). These immutable types now return `self` on copy, which is safe and fixes integration with `cks-runtime`'s `InMemoryStorage`.
- Added 4 regression tests for copy/deepcopy behaviour.

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-07-17

### Changed
- Repository renamed from `CKS` to `cks-core`.
- Updated all internal and ecosystem links to new repository URL.
- Added "Ecosystem" table to README.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Renamed PyPI distribution package from `canonical-ks` to `cks-core`
  to align with the `cks-*` ecosystem naming convention.
  Python import remains `import cks`.

---

### Notes

This is the first public release of the Canonical Knowledge Structure (CKS) reference implementation.

The implementation provides the initial executable realization of the CKS Core Specifications and establishes the foundation for future development of canonical constraints, reference corpora, documentation, and additional language implementations.
