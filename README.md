CKS is an open specification that defines how knowledge can be represented,
validated, exchanged, and evolved independently of programming languages,
document formats, databases, or AI systems.

Rather than introducing yet another serialization format or programming
language, CKS defines a **canonical semantic layer** shared by humans,
software, and artificial intelligence.

# Ecosystem

CKS Core is the semantic foundation of the CKS ecosystem.
Other projects build upon it:

| Project | Description | Repository |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **cks-core** | Canonical semantic engine (this repository) | [Deus-corp/cks-core](https://github.com/Deus-corp/cks-core) |
| **cks-runtime** | Operational environment – sessions, transactions, persistence | [Deus-corp/cks-runtime](https://github.com/Deus-corp/cks-runtime) |
| **cks-mcp** | MCP server – exposes CKS to LLMs | [Deus-corp/cks-mcp](https://github.com/Deus-corp/cks-mcp) |

# Why CKS?

Today the same knowledge exists simultaneously in many incompatible forms:

- documents
- databases
- JSON
- XML
- source code
- knowledge graphs
- ontologies
- AI prompts
- APIs

Each representation describes the same underlying knowledge differently.

CKS separates **knowledge itself** from every concrete representation.

```

Representations may change.

Canonical knowledge remains the same.

# Core Principles

CKS is founded on four simple principles.

### Knowledge exists independently of its representation.

Knowledge is not JSON.

Knowledge is not a PDF.

Knowledge is not source code.

Representations are temporary.

Knowledge is not.

---

### Structure preserves meaning.

Meaning is preserved by canonical structure rather than by syntax.

---

### Representation preserves structure.

Different representations may express the same canonical structure.

---

### Canonical operations belong to knowledge itself.

Validation.

Serialization.

Comparison.

Evolution.

Inspection.

These are operations on knowledge—not on files, databases, or programming
languages.

# Architecture

The CKS ecosystem consists of implementation-independent specifications.

| Specification | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| CKS-000 | Foundations and terminology |
| CKS-001 | Canonical semantic model |
| CKS-002 | Knowledge construction |
| CKS-003 | Canonical serialization |
| CKS-004 | Structure evolution |
| CKS-005 | Validation |
| CKS-006 | Reference Engine |
| CKS-007 | Canonical Knowledge Interface |
| CKS-008 | Conformance |
| CKS-009 | Reference Knowledge Corpus |
| CKS-B001 | Python Reference Implementation |

# Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install cks-core
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deus-corp/cks-core.git
cd CKS
pip install -e .
```

---

# Quick Example

```python
from cks import (
    construct,
    validate,
    serialize,
)

from cks.core import (
    KnowledgeObject,
    ObjectIdentity,
)

obj = KnowledgeObject(
    identity=ObjectIdentity(
        id="obj-1",
        type="Definition",
        name="Knowledge",
    )
)

structure = construct([obj])

result = validate(structure)

print(result.is_valid)

print(serialize(structure))
```

Or use the command line:

```bash
# Validate a knowledge structure
cks validate examples/corpus/valid_theory_example.json

# Evolve a structure by adding an object
cks evolve examples/corpus/valid_theory_example.json examples/corpus/evolve_add.json
```

Or convert between formats:

```bash
# Convert JSON‑LD to CKS
cks convert examples/corpus/person.jsonld --format json-ld --output person.cks.json

# Export CKS to Turtle
cks export examples/corpus/valid_theory_example.json --format turtle --output theory.ttl
```

---

# Testing

Run the complete conformance suite:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

Current status:

- 114 tests
- all passing

The test suite verifies:

- deterministic behaviour
- immutability
- observational purity
- canonical serialization
- validation correctness
- public API conformance
- structural equivalence

# Vision

CKS aims to establish a universal semantic foundation for knowledge
exchange between:

- humans
- software
- databases
- distributed systems
- artificial intelligence

through a single canonical representation of knowledge that is independent
of every concrete implementation.
